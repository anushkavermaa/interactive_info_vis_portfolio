          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This clock is meant to be used by people at airports who are waiting for their bag(s) to arrive at baggage claim. 
              There is currently no way to track baggage arrival in real-time.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> I chose to illustrate the suitcase and the person icon moving towards eachother
            to reflect the reality of what occurs at baggage claim. Seconds are counted down as the two icons get closer together. 
            I decided to have the icons move in a smooth, fluid motion to depict the natural flow of baggage claim. The dark gray 
            background helps to highlight the moving elements by creating contrast, and turns green to indicate when bags are on the 
            carousel. The written status text and countdown timer makes the visualization more understandable for those who are standing 
            a considerable distance away from the carousel.</li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> This clock could be improved by incorporating more detailed animations, such as having
              the person icon 'dance' or do some kind of motion when they receive their bag, or adding sound effects to indicate when 
              bags are about to arrive. It could also be useful to add more status update texts, such as "Your bags have been transferred
              off of the tarmac." This would help users understand the baggage claim process more clearly and alleviate impatience. A more
              technical improvement would be to figure out how this clock would actually be implemented at the airport. Right now it starts at
              30 seconds, but maybe having some location tracking feature on the actual bags would be more useful for people. </li>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This clock is meant to be used by people who are at the airport, waiting to board their flight.
              Waiting can be a long, annoying process, so the goal of this visualization is to add more fun to the experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> Since the purpose of the clock is to countdown time until boarding, I decided to center 
              the boarding time prominently on the boarding pass, in the middle, for easy visibility. Other information about the flight (flight number, 
              gate, from/to) is placed around it for context. The visualization starts an hour before boarding, and each bar represents 5 minutes.
              I included text about the countdown, including what each bar represents and when the countdown starts, for users to understand it better.
              I also made it interactive by allowing users to set their own boarding time so that they can test out the prototype and see
              how the bars appear.</li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> One possibility for future work is to add more elements that encode time, rather than just the bars that
              each represent 5 minutes. Having a visual to depict seconds could make the countdown more precise and engaging. Another improvement is to 
              make the barcode more prominent, possibly by increasing its size, adding animation effects, or moving it to the middle of the boarding pass.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This clock is for people who are waiting for their boarding group to be called at the airport. It counts
            down the time until their group is called in a quantitative and visual (gradient) manner.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> I decided to visualize the plane being filled up by the gradient because it is an accurate description
            of the boarding process– the more groups that are called, the more filled the plane is. Each group is given 7 minutes to board, and the 
            time remaining is displayed below the boarding group name to keep users informed. I also decided to include an interactive element, where users 
            can click their mouse to skip to the next boarding group. The bottom of the visualization also displays the overall boarding progress as a percentage,  
            so those waiting can easily see how much of the boarding process is complete.</li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> This clock could be improved by finding a way to make the gradient that fills the plane be more accurate, and actually
            fill the complete outline. I was trying to figure out how to do this but ran into some challenges with the shape complexity, and also the fact that I am new 
            to p5.js and interactive visualization. Another, more technical, improvement could be related to how this clock would actually be implemented. Rather than 
            defaulting to 7 minutes for each boarding group, it could dynamically adjust based on real-time data or user input to provide a more accurate countdown.</li>
